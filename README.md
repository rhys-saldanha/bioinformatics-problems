# bioinformatics stuff
WARNING: Please don't use this repo as a cheat sheet. I'm not the first to upload my solutions, and I won't be the last. 

This is a dump of code I wrote in 2013 as a result of using [Rosalind] ([link to my profile][user]) and Stepic websites to practice programming.

The problems solved are trivial and the programming style lacks polish as I self-taught python...

This is very much a nostalgia repo but I may resume solving the [problems on Rosalind][tree] in the future.
